Octopus Deploy 2.0 API Documentation
=======================================

[Octopus Deploy](http://octopusdeploy.com/) is a user-friendly automated deployment tool for .NET developers. This GitHub repository exists to provide documentation for the upcoming **Octopus Deploy 2.0** HTTP API. 

For Octopus Deploy 2.0, we're making a lot of changes and improvements to the API, and our goal is to make the Octopus user interface API driven. When we first built the API for Octopus Deploy, it didn't come with documentation. The goal of this GitHub repository is to document the API from the start. 

**To be clear, this is documentation for an upcoming, unreleased version of the API. While many of the concepts in this documentation also apply to the current API, some parts won't.**
